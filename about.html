        Hi, I think you already know my name. So let's talk about something else, I was born on February 9th 1995 at Dhaka, Bangladesh.

        <br/> <br/>

        In short I enjoy writing, eating, coding and watching movies/tv-series in my spare time. I have been writing articles online since 2010. I mostly write in Bengali, but now I've been writing on my <a href="http://blog.manash.me" target="_blank">medium blog</a> in English too.



        <br/><br/>

        I believe in sharing knowledge that's why I am open source enthusiast, all of my work is open sourced and always will be. I have keen interest in Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Organic Chemistry and Astrophysics.

        <br/> <br/>

        Besides, I love to read books, online technical and non technical articles. My hobby is to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla" target="_blank">Tabla</a> and design vector art.
